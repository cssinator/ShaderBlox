## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Does this lower my FPS?**
A: **Ultra** mode will lower FPS. If you have a slow PC, select **Lite** mode during installation for 0 FPS loss.

**Q: Is this a virus?**
A: No. BloxShade is a wrapper for ReShade (an open-source post-processing tool). It is 100% safe.
*Note: Some antiviruses might flag the installer because it modifies Roblox game files to inject graphics. This is a false positive.*

**Q: Can I get banned?**
A: **No.** Shaders are allowed by Roblox as they do not modify game memory or give an unfair advantage.
